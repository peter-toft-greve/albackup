# albackup
albackup is an rsync wrapper to make backups.
Original written by John MÃ¸rck Hansen, but abandoned

Works very well.

# Initial setup

Move sbin/albackup to /sbin/albackup/
Move etc/albackup/ to /etc/albackup/

In each of the /etc/albackup/*.conf (just copy the localhost.conf to each of the machines you like to backup).

In each of the files change these lines.

* CLIENT="localhost" - changes the name below BASEDIR
* CLIENT_IP="127.0.0.1" - IP address of the server to backup
* BASEDIR="/backup" - Location of the backup
* BACKUP_DIRS=(/dir1 /dir2 /dir3) - List of the directories to backup

# Usage
Run /sbin/albackup as root

Copies the /etc/albackup/*.conf files to the backuo directy as a full backup,
but using hardlinks, i.e. the sum of every backup costs roughly the same as one
full backup.

You can delete any data backups without loosing any files in the other
backups. Very clever.
